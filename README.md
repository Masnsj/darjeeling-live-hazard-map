This project is a hyper-local, real-time hazard and weather visualization system designed to capture precise micro-climate conditions that mainstream platforms often overlook. Darjeeling is used as the demonstration region, but the system can be deployed in any village, town, tea estate, or small settlement anywhere in the world, making it far more adaptable and accurate than general services like Google Weather. Instead of offering one broad forecast for an entire district, the system divides the area into multiple small zones—such as Kurseong, Sonada, Ghoom, Mirik, Takdah, and Darjeeling town—and represents each one as an interactive bubble on a live map. When a user selects a bubble, the system instantly displays real-time data for temperature, humidity, rainfall levels, wind speed, pressure, visibility, cloud cover, AQI, and other hazard-related indicators. This enables the detection of sudden localised changes, including humidity spikes, cloudbursts, fog formation, pressure drops, and rainfall surges—events that often vary dramatically over short distances in mountainous terrain. A standout feature is the Teesta River live depth monitor, which tracks river levels in real time and categorizes them into low, normal, or high alert states using adjustable thresholds. This is especially valuable during monsoon seasons, when upstream rainfall can rapidly alter river conditions. The backend uses efficient multithreading to continuously update live data without slowing the interface, while all API calls, errors, and timestamped refresh logs ensure transparency and easy debugging. With its clean, modular architecture, the platform is easy to expand with new zones, additional parameters, or automated warning systems. Overall, this project provides a high-resolution and scalable environmental monitoring tool that delivers unmatched accuracy for research teams, disaster-management groups, local authorities, travellers, and residents in geographically sensitive regions around the world.
