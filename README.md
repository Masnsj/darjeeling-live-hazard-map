# darjeeling-live-hazard-map
This project is a live, hyper-local hazard and weather monitoring system, demonstrated using Darjeeling as the sample region. While Darjeeling appears as the default map, the system is built to work with any village, town, tea estate or rural zone worldwide,making it far more adaptable,precise than conventional weather services like Google Weather.
